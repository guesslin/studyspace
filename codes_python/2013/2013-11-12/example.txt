Your English teacher has just asked you to write a paper comparing two of the
works from the free, online literature library at Project Gutenberg. Since you
are a computer scientist, you decide to put your skills to use. You plan to
compare your two favorite works of classic literature in terms of the
vocabulary used in each. Since this a bit outside the scope of the assignment
as described by your English teacher, you ask for permission before you
proceed. Intruiged by your proposal, your English teacher agrees and you are
ready to go.

You plan to write a program that will take a text file as input and return a
report listing alphabetically all the words in the file and the number of
occurances of each.
